# Emulation deep-dive

How the Snowsky Disc firmware is run without the hardware, and every non-obvious
thing that had to be true before the UI would reach its main screen.

## Stack

Current runtime profiles are V2.57 (default) and V2.40. The blocker investigations
below describe how support was established; raw function addresses refer to the
original V2.40 analysis unless labelled otherwise. Use [DIAGNOSTICS.md](../../research/docs/diagnostics.md)
for version-aware addresses and [VIEWER.md](../../viewer/docs/usage.md) for current interaction.

```
macOS/Linux host
  └─ Docker (privileged Linux VM)
       └─ qemu-mipsel-static (user-mode)   ← runs the MIPS32 guest binaries
            └─ chroot /work/rootfs         ← unpacked firmware root filesystem
                 ├─ mq_ui       (LVGL GUI, owns POSIX mqueue "ui")
                 └─ mq_player   (audio/backend, owns "player", pushes state to "ui")
```

- **User-mode** qemu (not full-system): we execute the two userland binaries directly;
  there is no guest kernel. Anything the binaries expect from the kernel/drivers we
  fake with sysfs/dev stubs and an ioctl shim.
- `--privileged` is required: qemu-user needs to reserve a large contiguous guest VA,
  binfmt_misc must be writable, and POSIX mqueues must be mountable.

## binfmt_misc — register ONLY mipsel

The guest does `popen()`/`execve()` of other MIPS binaries (`/bin/sh`, `cmd_watchdog`,
`cat …/name`). For those child execs to run, the kernel needs a binfmt_misc handler
that hands MIPS ELFs to qemu.

**Do not** run `qemu-binfmt --reset -p yes` / `multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset`: it
registers *every* qemu interpreter including `qemu-aarch64`, which then intercepts the
host VM's own native arm64 binaries (containerd-shim, unpigz, …) → `exec format error`,
breaking Docker until you restart Docker Desktop. This happened twice.

Instead register a single mipsel entry with a mask that matches MIPS32-LE ELFs and
nothing else (`emulator/scripts/10_setup_env.sh`). The mask ignores ELF bytes 6–15 so it matches
busybox (which sets `EI_ABIVERSION`) as well as glibc binaries.

## The ioctl shim (`emulator/shims/fbshim.c`)

The guest opens `/dev/fb0` and issues framebuffer ioctls, and reads input-device names.
There is no real framebuffer/driver, so an `LD_PRELOAD`-style shim intercepts `ioctl`:

- `FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO` → report 360×360, yres_virtual 1080, 32bpp, XRGB8888 (R@16 G@8 B@0 A@24)
- `FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO` → smem_len = 360·1080·4, line_length = 1440, visual TRUECOLOR
- `EVIOCGNAME` → return the input device name
- all other `0x46xx` fb ioctls (PAN/BLANK/PUT) → return 0 (no-op)
- Volume GPIO `pb13`/`pb14`, touch/LCD sleep/wake and DAC attenuation writes are emulated
  narrowly for physical controls; see [KEYS.md](keys.md).
- Framebuffer `mmap`/`memcpy` calls are observed to publish `emu/fb-live`; actual memory
  operations are delegated to the guest libc's `mmap64`/`memmove`.
- libc `reboot` is intercepted for guest BusyBox poweroff/reboot: no shared-kernel reboot,
  only an `emu/power-request` consumed by the viewer's guest-scoped supervisor.
- Empty `read` calls on `/dev/input/event0` wait 5 ms, preventing the physical-key
  reader from spinning on the regular-file stub's EOF. Actual reads delegate to the
  guest libc's `__read`; queued events and other files are not delayed.
- V2.57 USB sink-role/ADC1 reads follow the viewer cable byte, so the stock
  detector controls idle-power inhibition. Narrow device/ioctl gates leave other
  ADC channels unavailable and do not model USB data; see [IDLE_POWER.md](idle-power.md).

The shim is **freestanding** (`-nostdlib`, raw MIPS syscalls). A normal glibc-linked
`.so` fails to load because the host toolchain glibc (2.36) ≠ device glibc (2.29):
`cannot open shared object`. Freestanding + no NEEDED entries sidesteps that.

Two gotchas that were fixed:
- **nan2008**: the device loader is `ld-linux-mipsn8`; the shim's ELF `e_flags` must have
  the nan2008 bit or it is rejected. `build_shims.sh` stamps `0x70001407` at offset 36.
- **fd leak**: the shim logged to `/fbshim.log` on every ioctl and never closed the fd.
  Over the boot animation's hundreds of PAN ioctls this exhausted the fd table, and the
  *next* `mq_open("ui")` failed — which looked like an mqueue bug but was fd exhaustion.
  Fixed by closing the log fd (and not logging on the hot path).

It preloads via `/rootfs/etc/ld.so.preload` (a file the guest ld.so reads), **not**
`LD_PRELOAD`: the env var does not survive the guest's `popen()` children, and the path
must resolve inside the chroot.

`/dev/fb0` is a plain file; qemu maps it with `mmap` and the guest draws into it. See
[TOUCH.md](touch.md) / `emulator/runtime/fb2png.py` for reading it back.

## Blocker 1 — frozen splash: `mq_open("ui")` = EMFILE

`mq_ui` creates the POSIX message queue `ui` (`mq_maxmsg=32, mq_msgsize=8192`); `mq_player`
opens it and pushes UI state. Under emulation `mq_open` failed with **EMFILE** ("too many
open files") even though the process had ~8 fds open.

EMFILE from `mq_open` is not only the fd limit — it also fires on **`RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE`**
exhaustion (bytes of POSIX-queue memory per user). Each queue costs `maxmsg·msgsize` =
256 KB. Guest processes killed with SIGKILL leave their queues allocated in the kernel's
own mqueue instance, which a `mount -t mqueue …` view does **not** list, so
`rm /dev/mqueue/*` never freed them. After a handful of runs the limit was blown.

**Fix:** `ulimit -q 268435256` before launching. (qemu-user 7.2's mqueue passthrough is
otherwise correct — verified a clean glibc test binary creates `/dev/mqueue/qt` fine.)

## Blocker 2 — "battery too low, shutting down" screen

With the queue working, the UI left the splash but showed a battery icon and
`电量过低，倒计时关机 / 19S` (battery too low, shutdown countdown). The fuel gauge is read
from `/sys/class/power_supply/cw221X-bat/capacity`; absent, it reads 0%.

**Fix:** create that sysfs tree with `capacity=100, status=Full, …` (`10_setup_env.sh`).

## Blocker 3 — main screen built but never shown (boot animation overlay)

With a healthy battery the UI went *back* to the SNOWSKY splash and stayed. Tracing showed
`mq_ui` actually **built** the main screen (it opened all `main_screen/main_1/*.png` assets)
— but the boot logo animation (`power_on/opening_*.png`, state flag `power_on_ing`) is an
**infinite-loop overlay drawn on top** of it and never auto-clears under emulation (~17
loops observed). The config key `LOCAL_IMG_ANIM` controls it.

**Fix:** `sqlite3 sysconfig.db "UPDATE SYSCONFIG SET LOCAL_IMG_ANIM=0"` → the overlay is
skipped and the real first-boot flow can proceed. Current setup also presets
English, so the normal flow reaches the main menu without the language wizard;
the wizard appears only with an out-of-range `LANGUAGE` value.

**Catch on a fresh rootfs (two parts):** `/usr/data` is a **separate UBIFS partition** on the
device (`etc/init.d/S21mount_ubifs`) and is *empty* in the squashfs. On hardware the init
scripts `S98FIIO` + `fiio_init.sh` populate it from templates in the read-only rootfs. We
don't run init, so:

1. **Seed `/usr/data`** — most importantly copy the zlog configs
   `usr/project/config/zlog_{player,ui}.conf` → `usr/data/fiio/log/` (and `usr/project/db/*`,
   e.g. `dic.db`, → `usr/data/fiio/db/`). Without the zlog config, `mq_player`'s `zlog_init()`
   fails (`Error: zlog_init`), the backend never starts, and **no `sysconfig.db` is ever
   created** — so on a truly fresh rootfs you're stuck on the splash with an empty
   `usr/data/fiio/db/`.
2. **Priming boot** — even seeded, `sysconfig.db` is created by `mq_player` on first boot with
   `LOCAL_IMG_ANIM=1`. So a throwaway boot creates the DB, then we set `LOCAL_IMG_ANIM=0`, then
   boot for real.

`emulator/scripts/10_setup_env.sh` does both automatically. (The language choice and this flag then
persist in the `/work` volume.)

The first-boot **language wizard** is gated on the same DB: it shows only while `LANGUAGE` is
out of range (fresh default 100). `LANGUAGE` is a **0-based index** (switch in mq_ui
`FUN_004776e4`): `0 zh · 1 tw · 2 en · 3 ja · 4 ko · 5 es · 6 it · 7 de · 8 pt · 9 ru`. Setting
any valid value picks the language and skips the wizard; `10_setup_env.sh` presets `LANG_CODE`
(default 2 = English). (Out-of-range codes like 100/102 fall back to Chinese — which is why the
"language index = code − 100" guess was wrong.)

## Blocker 4 — the SD card / File Browser shows nothing

With the main menu reached, opening **Browse files** showed an empty `/tmp/sdcard`. The card
is emulated as a **real FAT block device**, not a bind: `10_setup_env.sh` builds a FAT image
from `./emulator/sdcard`, exposes it as real nodes `/dev/mmcblk0` + `/dev/mmcblk0p1` (`mknod b 7 <loop
minor>` — a symlink to `/dev/loopN` can't be resolved from inside the guest's chroot), and
mounts it at `/tmp/sdcard`. Yet the browser stayed empty.

The cause is in `mq_ui`'s `util/src/mount_storage_dev.c`. Three facts decompiled/observed:

- The card is gated on `system("[ -e /dev/mmcblk0 ]")` (`FUN_004891b8`) — hence the real node.
- `FUN_004147ac` parses `/proc/mounts` for the **exact** mountpoint string `/tmp/sdcard`.
- On startup `mq_ui` **`umount`s `/tmp/sdcard` once** and expects a hotplug handler to remount
  the card (`mount -o iocharset=utf8 /dev/mmcblk0p1 /tmp/sdcard`). On hardware `mdev`/init does
  that on the insert uevent; **under emulation nothing does**, so the mount we set up is torn
  down and never comes back — the browser scans an empty dir.

Two red herrings ruled out along the way: it is **not** a Docker-volume mount-propagation
problem (the guest's own `mount -o iocharset=utf8` runs fine under qemu-chroot even though
`/work` is `private,slave` — a fresh mount under it is `private` and survives), and it does
**not** need a synthetic netlink uevent — the File Browser **re-scans `/tmp/sdcard` live on
entry**, so the card just has to be mounted when you open the app.

**Fix (`sd_mount()` in `lib.sh`, called from `10_setup_env.sh`, the end of `20_boot.sh`, and
`30_tap.sh`):** after the boot-time umount, re-mount `/dev/mmcblk0p1 -o iocharset=utf8` at
**both** the guest rootfs path `…/rootfs/tmp/sdcard` (the content the browser reads) and the
container's own `/tmp/sdcard`. The guest is chrooted, so its `umount /tmp/sdcard` only hits the
rootfs path — the container-path mount survives and keeps the exact `/tmp/sdcard` line
`FUN_004147ac` looks for present across the whole boot. The browser then lists the card and is
navigable all the way to the leaf tracks (`Test Artist / Greatest Hits / *.wav`).

Current setup mounts the guest card **inside chroot**, so the source recorded in
`/proc/mounts` is `/dev/mmcblk0p1`; see the scanner fix below. The viewer now also
supports explicit SD removal/insertion. Boot remounting and insertion-triggered
auto-scanning remain separate operations; see [MEDIA_LIBRARY.md](media-library.md).

## Scanner source-path fix (2026-09-11)

Browse files only needed the mountpoint above; **Update media lib** also checks
that the mount source is accessible inside chroot. The old container-side mount
recorded `/work/rootfs/dev/mmcblk0p1`, which fails that check. `sd_mount()` now mounts
the guest SD **inside chroot**, recording source `/dev/mmcblk0p1`. This fixed the
scanner stuck at zero: the stock scan found four tracks, and the same four appeared
over FiiO Link. Existing old-source mounts are migrated; the container-side helper
mount is retained. See [NETWORK.md](network.md).

## What mq_player sends at boot

Sniffing the `ui` queue (see `research/diagnostics/uisniff.c`) shows the backend push these FiiO-Link
frames right after start (there is **no** explicit "show main" command — the transition is
internal to `mq_ui` once the animation is gone):

| tag | value | meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `aa1d` | `0064` | battery = 100 |
| `a634` | 0 | — |
| `aa24` | `{"volume":120,"brightness":20,"dac_filter":1,…}` | settings blob |
| `a102` | 0 | play state |
| `a712` | 0 | — |
| `a620` | `{"SN":"","NB":"","WIFI_MAC":…}` | device info |
| `aa1c` | 0 | — |
| `a202` | `{"state":2}` | player state |

See [PROTOCOL.md](../../docs/protocol/protocol.md) for the frame format.

## Framebuffer capture

`fb0` = 360×1080×4 (three 360×360 sub-buffers). `mq_ui` does **not** use `FBIOPAN_DISPLAY`;
it alternates drawing to buf0/buf1, so the current screen is the **last-flushed** buffer
(a static screen is not re-flushed, so the other buffer holds a stale frame). `emulator/runtime/fb2png.py`
emits every sub-buffer and prints each one's non-black pixel count. For the actual latest
buffer, use the shim's `emu/fb-live` byte (0/1; 255 = no observation yet), also consumed by
the viewer. Higher pixel count is only a heuristic, not evidence of recency. Pixels are
BGRX and the panel is 180°-rotated, so the converter reverses pixel order.

## Ordering / timing

Start `mq_ui` first (creates `ui`), then `mq_player` (retries `mq_open("ui")`).
Current `20_boot.sh` waits for network listeners, both input devices and a new
framebuffer flush, then remounts the SD before capturing. Input/frame readiness
has a 60-second timeout. The historical ~20–24 s boot measurement is not a fixed
startup delay; `./run.sh boot <seconds>` adds only an optional diagnostic wait.

## Known hardware errors

`WATCHDOG: feed failed`, `adc get voltage failed: Bad file descriptor`,
`gpio_get_value fail` for unemulated pins — from absent hardware; the backend keeps running.
The volume pins and brightness/touch/LCD paths are now handled. A missing brightness path
or failures reading `pb13`/`pb14` indicate an outdated setup/shim and break screen sleep
or held buttons; see [KEYS.md](keys.md). The
initial **`open("/dev/gpio")` must succeed** or `mq_player` aborts with `failed to open
device` before it inits the DAC / pushes UI state (→ stuck splash). So `10_setup_env.sh`
creates 0-byte stubs for `/dev/gpio`, `/dev/jz_adc_aux_0`, `/dev/jz_watchdog` (open works,
later ioctls generally still fail). V2.57 `15_controls.sh` additionally installs
USB-power stubs: ADC enable succeeds for sequential channel initialization,
ADC1 reports cable state, and ADC0/2/3 reads explicitly fail with ENODEV.
Those other sensors are not needed for boot and are not emulated.

## Troubleshooting

- **`fb2png` prints `…-b2 non_black_px=0`** — normal. There are three sub-buffers; `mq_ui`
  only ever draws to buf0/buf1 (alternating), so buf2 stays black. Prefer the
  `emu/fb-live` marker (0/1) or the viewer's `/frame` endpoint for the current frame.
  Non-black counts alone cannot distinguish an old frame from the latest one.
- **`sysconfig.db missing` on the very first `10_setup_env` of a fresh rootfs** — expected
  (see the `/usr/data` catch above); the script seeds `/usr/data` then primes the DB. If it
  still reports missing after priming, check `/work/mq_player.log`.
- **`/work/mq_player.log` = `Error: zlog_init`** — the backend can't init logging because the
  zlog config isn't in `usr/data/fiio/log/`. `10_setup_env.sh` seeds it from
  `usr/project/config/zlog_{player,ui}.conf`; if the seed step didn't run (older checkout),
  `git pull` and re-run, or copy those two files manually.
- **`docker run`/`docker start`/`docker exec` hangs and a new container is stuck in
  `Created`** — the Docker Desktop VM got wedged (often after an earlier OOM or a killed
  `docker` operation left a zombie containerd-shim). Existing containers keep working, but new
  ones won't start. Fix: **restart Docker Desktop**, then `./run.sh up …` again. Give the VM
  ≥8 GB (two qemu-user MIPS processes plus the popen/`cmd_watchdog` children are memory-hungry;
  running out is what wedges it).
