# Documentation

Component manuals live beside their code. This index connects them with the
shared protocol, architecture and development documentation.

[Curated screenshots](images/README.md) remain shared assets under `docs/images/`.
Private recordings, catalogs, firmware and raw captures do not belong in documentation.

## Finding moved pages

Former uppercase pages under `docs/` now have descriptive lowercase names beneath
their owner. For example, `CONTROLLER_API.md` is now
[`controller/docs/api.md`](../controller/docs/api.md); Assistant pages are grouped
under [`experiments/disc_assistant/docs/`](../experiments/disc_assistant/docs/README.md).
Git history preserves the former paths. Maintained repository links point to the
canonical page; there are no duplicate copies of the manuals.

Run `python3 -m ci.docs` from the repository root to check local Markdown targets.
The hosted firmware-free workflow runs the same check without firmware or services.
