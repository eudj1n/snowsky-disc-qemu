# Disc Assistant status

Current on 2026-09-21. The Assistant is an active experimental application with
an accepted **software MVP against stock V2.57**. Start with the
[command quick guide](guides/quick-guide.md) or [setup](guides/setup.md).

## Implemented behavior

- [Vosk RU TTS](guides/tts.md#optional-vosk-tts) adds five explicitly selected voices
  through the same normalization and resident-worker contracts.

- [Silero RU and TTS normalization](guides/tts.md#optional-silero-ru) add resident
  synthesis, explicit integer/percentage rules and optional offline RUNorm.
  Normalization affects only spoken text; RUNorm remains opt-in after observed errors.
- [Speech adapters and profiles](guides/voice-adapters.md) share versioned contracts,
  explicit factories and lifecycle checks. Optional GigaAM code and historical
  pilot evidence are ported; board performance remains unverified.
- CLI, persistent text console and browser text/microphone adapters share one
  application flow. Web selects Whisper Server or optional resident Sherpa RU
  per recording, with Preview on engine changes and optional configured TTS replies.
- Russian/English requests find tracks, artists and albums, control playback and
  queues, like/unlike the current track, report now-playing and set volume.
  Relative volume defaults to ±20 with independently configurable steps.
- Unqualified music searches prioritize verified current album/artist context.
  Explicit scopes are retained; fresh Controller checks precede selection.
- Working rules and typed intentions belong to `assistant/nlu/`. Optional learned
  sources remain shadow-only; locale templates are separate from frozen corpora.
- Controller owns connection state, reviewed firmware compatibility, mutation
  pacing and typed device operations. Assistant owns language, ranking, storage
  and response policy. See [architecture](architecture/pipeline.md).

One action and one saved interaction locale per request remain required. An
uncertain mutation is never automatically replayed. Reconnect recovers observations.

## Acceptance and regression evidence

| Evidence | Result and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| [Vosk TTS](reports/2026-09-21-vosk-tts.md) | 431 tests (4 optional skips); all five voices passed five RU phrases, but each failed on the mixed Latin-name phrase. |
| [Silero/normalization](reports/2026-09-21-silero-normalization.md) | 421 tests (4 optional skips), 18 synthetic comparison WAVs. Pronunciation quality and board performance are not certified. |
| [Speech adapters/profiles](reports/2026-09-21-voice-adapters.md) | 409 tests (4 optional skips), real STT/TTS integration probes and five disposable V2.57 regression cases. No new human-speech/platform acceptance. |
| [Accepted software MVP](reports/2026-09-19-mvp-acceptance.md) | Candidate `48477e8`: 64/64 text cases, 35 RU / 29 EN; 19 no-mutation cases with zero writes. Existing accepted evidence, not a new run. |
| [Voice-command/Controller extension](reports/2026-09-21-development-checkpoints.md#pythoncontroller-review-follow-up-2026-09-21) | Corrected extension run: 30/30, including ten no-write cases; full V2.57 integration also passed. Earlier failed runs remain recorded separately. |
| [Repository reorganization](../../../docs/development/reports/2026-09-21-repository-refactor.md) | Import/path regression checks and one disposable now-playing scenario; no new physical or speech-quality acceptance. |

These are finite regression results. The accepted 64-case cohort uses text input;
owner-reported physical microphone successes do not establish a human-speech error
rate. The [MVP contract](reference/mvp.md) defines the accepted scope.

## Follow-up boundaries

- [Physical acceptance #23](https://github.com/eudj1n/snowsky-disc-qemu/issues/23)
  remains unpassed. Preserve the original 19-RU observations and disputed gold;
  use the [physical baseline](evaluation/physical-baseline.md) when resumed.
- [Speech/platform work #24](https://github.com/eudj1n/snowsky-disc-qemu/issues/24)
  remains separate and deferred: representative human speech, pronunciation,
  native/Docker/Orange Pi comparisons and latency. No new benchmark is implied.
- Learned execution, semantic retrieval, dialogue/compound planning, wake word/VAD,
  recommendations and dock hardware remain future decisions.
- Controller packaging is implemented; publication and repository extraction have
  not occurred. See the [quality review](../../../docs/development/reports/2026-09-21-python-quality.md).

The [roadmap](roadmap.md) routes future work to its owning issue.
[Development checkpoints](reports/2026-09-21-development-checkpoints.md) preserve
timings, failures and older test counts; [design history](reports/2026-09-21-design-history.md)
preserves superseded implementation plans.
